1,"What is the Youth Guarantee?
The Youth Guarantee is a commitment by all Member States to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good quality offer of

employment,
continued education,
apprenticeship,
traineeship
within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.

All EU countries have committed to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in a Council Recommendation of April 2013.

Memo - Communication on the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative: Questions and Answers (October 2016)

What has been achieved so far?
The Youth Guarantee has become a reality across the EU and has helped to improve the lives of millions of young Europeans.

More than 5 million young people have registered in YG schemes each year since 2014.
Since 2014, each year more than 3.5 million young people registered in the YG took up an offer of employment, continued education, a traineeship or an apprenticeship. 
More than two thirds of young people who left the Youth Guarantee in 2016 took up an offer of employment, education, traineeship or apprenticeship.
The Youth Employment Initiative has provided direct support to over 1.7 million young people across the EU.

Four years on from when the Youth Guarantee took off, young people¡¯s labour market performance has improved significantly:

There are almost 2 million fewer young unemployed in the EU and 1 million less young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs).
Youth unemployment has dropped from a peak of 23.7% in 2013 to 18.7% in 2016.
The share of 15-24 year olds not in employment, education or training (NEETs) has fallen from 13.2% in 2012 to 11.5% in 2016.
Even if such trends should be seen in the context of cyclical factors, the Youth Guarantee accelerates progress by increasing opportunities for young people.

Success stories
The Youth Guarantee has significantly facilitated structural reforms and innovation in policy design across EU Member States. In 2013-2015, Member States adopted a total of 132 labour market measures targeting young people, highlighting a strong focus on youth employment policies. Member States can be divided into three groups according to the degree to which the Youth Guarantee has acted as a driver for reform.

Image showing which country belongs to which group. The first group, which contains the countries where there is accelerated reform consists of the following countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Poloand, Portugal and Slovenia. The countries belonging to the group 

Significant reforms and innovative measures have been introduced within the framework of national Youth Guarantee schemes.

For instance, in Bulgaria, a network of youth mediators was put in place in 2015 to reach out to non-registered NEETs in their direct environment and activate them. Youth mediators act as intermediaries with public institutions that provide social, health, educational and other services.
The apprenticeship system in Spain has undergone significant structural reforms, leading to an increase in the number of apprentices from 4 000 to 15 000 in just three years (between 2013 and 2016). During the same period, the number of enterprises participating in apprenticeship training grew from barely 500 to 5 660.
In 2015, Finland launched one-stop guidance centres for youth, which aim to strengthen and simplify services for young people and to eliminate the duplication of activities. Located in 35 municipalities so far, they provide low-threshold support to all young people below the age of 30, including personal advice and guidance, support in life management, career planning, social skills, as well as education and employment support.
In the Commission Staff Working Document on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and the operation of the Youth Employment Initiative you can find an overview of further national reforms and measures.

How have Youth Guarantee schemes been set up?
Developing and delivering a Youth Guarantee scheme requires strong partnerships between all the key stakeholders: public authorities, employment services, career guidance providers, education & training institutions, youth support services, business, employers, trade unions, etc.

Early intervention and fast-acting measures to support young people's activation are essential and, in many cases, structural reforms are needed, such as improving vocational education and training systems and strengthening the public employment service's (PES) capacity to implement the Youth Guarantee.

The EU has supported Member States in establishing their national Youth Guarantee schemes through substantial financial as well as policy support and mutual learning activities. In particular, the European Commission has helped each Member State to develop and deliver its own national Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan. Further, the Commission also facilitates the sharing of best practices between governments, in particular through the European Employment Strategy Mutual Learning Programme.

Cost-benefits of a Youth Guarantee
Recent research estimates the benefits of establishing a national Youth Guarantee scheme much higher than the costs. The total estimated cost of establishing Youth Guarantee schemes in all Member States of the European Union is around 50 bn a year, or around 0.39% of GDP (Source: EUROFOUND - Social Inclusion of Young People).

However, inaction would be much more costly. Young people not in employment, education or training are estimated to cost the EU ¢æ162bn (1.21% of GDP) a year ? in benefits and foregone earnings and taxes (Source: Eurofound - Mapping youth transitions in Europe).

Not all Youth Guarantee measures are expensive. For example, a strengthened partnership between stakeholders is effective without requiring large budgets.

Funding
To make the Youth Guarantee a reality, national budgets should prioritise youth employment to avoid higher costs in the future. The EU will add to national spending on these schemes through the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative."
2,"The Youth Guarantee country by country
The implementation of the Youth Guarantee has started in all EU countries and is already bringing results. Compared to other structural reforms in Europe, the Youth Guarantee is probably one of the most rapidly implemented.
What are EU countries doing?
All EU countries have presented comprehensive Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans, complying with the deadlines set by the European Council.
The plans identify precisely the measures to be taken to implement the Youth Guarantee. They outline the timeframe for youth employment reforms and measures, the roles of public authorities and other organisations, and how it will be financed.
Use the drop-down menu or the map above to get the plan for a specific country, when published. All plans are published under the responsibility of the corresponding Member State.
Some Member States have also set up national Youth Guarantee websites, with regular updates and/or the possibility for young people to register online. Use the drop-down menu or the map above to get to these websites, when they exist.
The implementation of national plans is now underway. EU countries are making substantial efforts to implement the Youth Guarantee, which has proven to be a driver for structural reforms. The Joint Employment Reports 2017 and 2018 list promising steps with concrete examples in many countries."
3,"What is the Youth Guarantee?
The Youth Guarantee is an action taken by the Council of the European Union aiming to fight unemployment among young people.
In Luxembourg, the Youth Guarantee is implemented by ADEM, the Local Action for Youth (ALJ), and the National Youth Service (SNJ). The three organisations work closely together to help you determine the right pathway to your future working life. Their common challenge is to offer you, within 4 months after your formal registration to the Youth Guarantee, a real perspective and added value concerning your professional future. This might be a job, an apprenticeship, a training measure, further education or practical experience during a voluntary service.
The Guarantee for Youth does not guarantee a job! But it guarantees individual, tailor-made support adapted to your personal situation, putting you on the right track to succeed in your professional future."
4,"A European Youth Guarantee will help young people
28. 02. 2013
Brussels, 28 February 2013 // The European Youth Forum welcomes the Employment and Social Policy Council recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee in Europe adopted today.

The European Youth Forum promoted today, in cooperation with Eurofound and the Youth Intergroup of the European Parliament, an event to discuss the costs and remedies of youth unemployment and youth disengagement. The high participation of youth organisations, Members of the European Parliament, representatives from the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee shows that is high time for the implementation of a European Youth Guarantee.

¡°What we need is a Youth Guarantee that is not just words to ¡®label¡¯ existing policy or funds, but a substantial investment in upskilling and bringing young people in the labour market,¡± says Peter Matja?i?, President of the European Youth Forum.

The Youth Guarantee is not policy that has come out of thin air. Youth unemployment is a huge cost to Europe, and in more ways than one. The European Youth Forum and youth organisations have been highlighting for years that unemployment when young not only hinders personal development and lowers life chances, exposing youth to poverty and social exclusion, but also prevents young Europeans from contributing to the overall development of their local community, their country and Europe as a whole. The Eurofound report presented today calculates the yearly cost of young NEETs (Not in Employment, Education or Training) reaching ¢æ 153 billion in 2011.

¡°Today is a turning point, after the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council recommendations, we regret the reservations of so many Member States and hope all reluctant Member States will now start really investing in young people,¡± added Matja?i?.

The European Youth Forum particularly welcomes the need of ensuring the consultation or involvement of young people and youth organisations in designing and further developing the Youth Guarantee scheme, as a positive best practice to tailor services to the real needs young people.

However, the amounts and the targets foreseen in the 2014-2020 cycle as a follow-up to the Commission¡¯s Youth Employment package risk being insufficient and unable to make any real impact. The ¢æ6 billion allocated is not sufficient in order to bring in an EU-wide Youth Guarantee and is unlikely to even be sufficient to tackle youth unemployment in the regions identified as having a youth unemployment rate that is higher than the EU average."
5,"Towards a real and effective youth guarantee in Europe

Brussels, 20 June 2016

To the members of the Executive Committee


Towards a real and effective Youth Guarantee in Europe

Adopted at the Executive Committee of June

BACKGROUND

Youth unemployment and precariousness are still at unacceptable levels in Europe. As unemployment rates for young people in Europe were already significantly higher (if not double) to those of the total workforce before the crisis, the situation skyrocketed once the world economy collapsed and the European governments and institutions opted for facing the situation by austerity policies.

Statistics show a recent modest decrease of youth unemployment, remaining above 20% at European level, with important divergences between European countries. Intra-categorical analysis shows that young women and migrant workers have been even more hit by unemployment and the degradation of the labour market. The inactive population and young people who are neither in employment nor in education or training (NEETs) increased, as well as the number of young EU migrants to other EU countries or abroad.

When it comes to analysing the quality of the jobs available for young people, underemployment is growing, considered as involuntary part-time and fixed term work or working below the qualification levels of the workers. Many youngsters are in precarious jobs: zero-hour contracts, bogus self-employment and undeclared work are becoming the negative features of the labour market for the European youth. When it comes to wages, young people are overrepresented among workers earning a minimum wage or even below minimum wages, because of derogations mainly affecting youngsters. They have been particularly affected in those countries where decision has been take to cut or to freeze these wages. Behind quantitative figures that show a relative decrease of unemployment, precariousness is growing with young people at the forefront.

Improving the labour market opportunities for young people has been high on the ETUC agenda for many years so far. The need to boost quality jobs for young people is included in the Congress resolutions of Paris and the ETUC plan for investment ¡°A New path for Europe¡±. In July 2013 the European social partners adopted the Framework of Actions on Youth Employment, and the ETUC and its national affiliates are working now in the third year of follow-up of this agreement. The ETUC is currently undertaking negotiations towards a framework agreement on inter-generational solidarity and active ageing, in which activation measures for young people into the labour market are understood as a pre-requisite for the European trade union movement.

The ETUC ? Youth Committee has been defending quality measures for young workers in Europe, denouncing the precarious working conditions for young people, and identifying and sharing best practices in organizing and representing young workers.

The ETUC acknowledges that initiatives have been put forward by the European Commission to try to find solutions to the situation of young workers in the labour market.

The ¡°flagship initiative¡± on youth named ¡°Youth on the move¡±, included in the Europe 2020 strategy already included some interesting measures like the initiative ¡°Your First Eures Job¡± and paved the way for upcoming policy packages such as the Youth Opportunities Initiative (2011) and the Youth Employment Package (2012). The first one put forward a set of measures to boost youth employment by preventing early school-leaving, developing skills, and other offer-oriented measures. The Youth Employment Package comprised a range of different measures from which some are clearly inspired by ETUC demands, like the Youth Guarantee or the Quality Framework for Traineeships, or projects initiated by European social partners like the European Alliance for Apprenticeships (EAfA). The Council of the European Union adopted on April 2013 a Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee which was followed by an endorsement at the June 2013 European Council, and financial mechanism of ¢æ6bn was made available for regions at NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level suffering youth unemployment rates above 25%. The European Social Fund continued providing support for every member states on fostering youth employment initiatives also including the Youth Guarantee.

The ETUC pushed EU institutions for the launch of the Youth Guarantee and welcomed its implementation. The establishment of such a guarantee in Europe was advocated by the ETUC and the ETUC Youth Committee as early as 2009 in its call ¡°Towards a new social deal in Europe: Fight the crisis, put people first¡±.

The ETUC proposals for a Youth Guarantee calls for a strong partnership approach, where social partners, youth organisations, schools and training institutions, private employment providers and third sector organisations, who are involved in the design, implementation, delivering and monitoring of the Youth Guarantee. A recent study published by the ETUC[1] revealed that this partnership approach took place unevenly across Europe and that the involvement of social partners was often not sufficient.

Concerning the effective mobilisation of the EU dedicated funds for the Youth Guarantee, the European Commission made public in December 2015 that only 2/3 of the allocated budget had been used by Member states. Taking into consideration the precarious situation of young people in the European labour market and their inactivity and unemployment rates, especially in Southern and Eastern European countries, the ETUC finds unacceptable that some national governments are not making use of the resources available.

The Commission will decide whether or not to extend the funding for this initiative into 2016 based on the member states¡¯ reports on the implementation and impact of the Youth Employment Initiative, which are both due for submission at the end of this year. Due to the lack of mobilisation of member states, the budget allocated to the Youth Employment Initiative (that covers the Youth Guarantee) is threatened and risks being put into question in the debate on the midterm review of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the EU.

ETUC DEMANDS

The ETUC is determined to not let this measure being abandoned or downgraded. A real and effective Youth Guarantee is still needed, as a right for all young Europeans to be guaranteed strong career guidance and counselling while they are entering the job market. Such a right could not be effective for young people within two years and must be at the core of a long-term strategy. It is not acceptable that the YG (as it happened in some countries) only delivers internships or low-quality short term jobs. The focus must be put again on quality jobs.
Therefore, the ETUC calls the European Commission and the national governments to:
a)   Fully implement the core principles of the European Youth Guarantee: a guaranteed offer and intervention within four months after leaving education system and/or unemployment. Implemented, in the long term as a universal guarantee.
b)   Ensure full participation of social partners, civil society and young people in the design and the assessment of the measure.
c)   Include clear requirement for an appropriate social protection in the youth guarantee schemes, in order to combat the risk of poverty and precariousness.
d)   Guarantee high quality standards of job offers, trainings, traineeships and apprenticeships, particularly in sectors where job creation will be important in the future.
e)   Encouraging synergies between programmes and institutions (public employment services, local authorities, etc.) in order to better fulfil the goals of the Youth Guarantee.
f)    Improving trust in institutions and increase the institutional capacity for delivering services. Crucial aspects are adequate financing and human resources ensuring a high quality guidance service for young people.
g)   Carefully design the target population and provide tailored approaches in order to respond to the heterogeneity of the youth population. This is particularly important if we take into account the future envisaged actions on young refugees and their access to the labour market.
h)   Invest in more ambitious and long-term funding so as to guarantee effective outcomes from the implementation of the measure. The ETUC calls for the continuation of the budgetary lines beyond 2016. Our benchmark in terms of appropriate funding of the Youth Guarantee is the estimation of 21bn¢æ per year made by the ILO.
The ETUC and its Youth committee will campaign in the coming months for this real and effective Youth Guarantee to becoming a reality in Europe. The main action undertaken will be:
a)   June 23rd: In an event jointly organized with Group II of the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Youth Forum, the ETUC Youth Committee will present the preliminary results of its research on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee at national level, with a focus on the partnership.
b)   October 2016: Photo action during the Executive Committee. Reinforcing the call to mobilizing in support of the Youth Guarantees.
c)   November 2016: Presentation of the results of the ETUC ? Youth research in parallel to those of the European Commission."
6,"¡°Youth Guarantee to ACTIVate and EmpowerYOUTH in Cyprus: an integrated communications campaign¡± (Project Acronym: ¡°Active Youth¡±)

¡°Active Youth¡± aims to inform and activate young people (mainly NEETs, i.e Not in Education, Employment or Training) on ?? available employment plans which fall under the Youth Guarantee Initiative. The programme also aims to encourage young people to join the Public Employment Service in order to help them in their search for employment, education or training. The ultimate goal of the program is to combat youth unemployment and to educate both young people and other stakeholders involved in youth issues through their participation in educational workshops and seminars.

The ¡°Youth Guarantee¡± Recommendation was established by the EU to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 are offered employment, continuous training, apprenticeship or work within a period of 4 months from the moment they become unemployed or exit formal education.

In the context of the implementation of the programme, two major surveys and 10 focus groups will be conducted in order to trace the current situation and the level of young people¡¯s knowledge of the Youth Guarantee. Upon completion of these, a major media campaign will be carried out. Five young people will be selected as youth guarantee ambassadors and will actively participate in this media campaign through spots, but also in TV shows etc.

The partners of Youth Board of Cyprus for the implementation of the Active Youth Programme are the Department of Labor ? the Ministry of Labor and Social Insurance, the Youth Council of Cyprus and the Cyprus Youth Organization.

The program is co-funded by the European Commission¡¯s Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Social Inclusion.

7,"Why 2018 is key to the EU¡¯s Youth Guarantee

If 2018 is officially the European Year of Cultural Heritage according to the European Commission, it should also be the Year of Youth. Unemployment for people younger than 25 years old remains high.


The youth needs to be empowered for the future, and this implies making sure young people don¡¯t fall into a never-ending series of job-looking search or unpaid internships and precarious jobs after they have finished their scholarship. To tackle this issue, the European Commission has set up the Youth Guarantee in 2013 in order to get young people back on their feet and stay out-of-work less long. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this Youth Guarantee, and how could 2018 be a key year to improve it? Find out more below.

How does the Youth Guarantee work?

The Youth Guarantee is a Council recommendation that aims at ensuring that all ¡°young people under the age of 25 years receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education¡± (Council, 2013). Since it is a recommendation, it is not legally binding. The Youth Guarantee also contributes to three of the ¡®Europe 2020¡¯ strategy targets, namely the increase in employment, the decrease in early school leavers, and the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The Youth Guarantee costs ¢æ21 billion a year and is funded at the European level, primarily by the Youth Employment Initiative ? which is for the regions where youth unemployment is above 25% -, and by the European Social Fund, for a total of ¢æ12,7 billion for the 2014-2020 budget (Barbi?re, 2014). It is an example of informal europeanisation: non-mandatory decisions are taken at the EU level, the funding at both the EU and national levels, and the implementation at the national and regional/local levels. The EU hopes that this initiative will help foster national reforms, diffuse informal rules and strategies, as well as having more policy harmonisation in the EU. The Guarantee is meant to help, not to replace, national social policies and instruments.

Assessment of the Youth Guarantee

If we simply look at a graph showing unemployment figures in the EU over time, one can directly notice that starting from 2013, when the Youth Guarantee was created, the youth unemployment rate was at at an all time high of 24%, and then has kept decreasing annually, down to almost 16% in December 2017, 18% for in the Euro area (Eurostat, 2017). Nonetheless, is it really thanks to the Youth Guarantee, or simply just because of the economic cyclical context? Or both? According to the European Commission, the Youth Guarantee has been quite effective in decreasing the youth unemployment rate, by facilitating ¡°structural reforms and innovation in policy design¡± across EU Member States (European Commission, 2016). The Guarantee did help transferring some of the best European models, for example in school-to-work transition (mainly from Finland or Norway) to other EU Member States (Andor, 2016). For instance, this led to a recent positive  shake-up of the traineeship program in Spain.

But on the other hand, critics almost unanimously agree that the Youth Guarantee has had disappointing results. Although the Youth Guarantee may have accelerated the process of increased employment, almost 6 million young people in working age remain without any jobs, and according to scholars, most of the drop in youth unemployment, and unemployment in general, is caused by the independent cyclical recovery of the economy (Barslund and Gros, 2017). Furthermore, the EU Court of Auditor itself stated in a special report last year that the Guarantee had a limited and slow impact and failed to meet the initial predictions (European Court of Auditors, 2017). The person in charge of the report, Iliana Ivanova criticized that ¡°policymakers should ensure that programs designed to help young people do not raise expectations which cannot be fulfilled¡± (ZAVR?NIK, 2017). Finally, some EU Member States seem to have been short in their commitment in implementing some new reforms or listening to EU¡¯s recommendations, such as Romania or Czechia.

2018, a pivotal year

According to Luis Alvarado Martinez, President of the European Youth Forum, young Europeans are ¡°the generation who has had to bear the highest cost of the economic crisis and the group in society most at risk of poverty and social exclusion¡±(Martinez, 2018). The future of the European society should be based on sustainable living, quality jobs, and equality of opportunity for all. For this, we would need to invest in youth. The time is now.

Following a 2017 EU survey, 31% of EU population cited ¡°combating youth unemployment¡± as what should be a top priority for the European Parliament (European Parliament). Moreover, according to a new World Economic Forum survey, entrepreneurship and youth empowerment should be the top priorities of European millennials (WEF, 2017). This is only possible by decreasing youth joblessness and by investing in youth. Not doing what is needed, some scholars say, could lead to a ¡°lost generation incapable of catching up later in life¡± (Cahuc et al., 2013). It¡¯s not yet the case today: macroeconomic aggregate data shows that there are still no lost generation (Barslund and Gros, ibid), but we must act quickly if we want to keep it that way. In addition to this, there is a link between youth unemployment and the increase of euroscepticism in those young people (Ellinger, 2015). The EU certainly doesn¡¯t need any more euroscepticism this year.

2018 is also key, because it is this year, in May, that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will be released. It will directly impact the entire budget of the EU from 2020 to 2027. During the last years, the budget of the EU kept rising. It is therefore a good opportunity for the EU Member States to focus on youth and increase the maximum budget of the Youth Employment Initiative, the ESF, and other social funds. It is their opportunity to invest more in youth.

However, with Brexit, the budget could actually shrink in this field, and not increase. But we know from Commissioner Oettinger that Member States will prioritise education and that there won¡¯t be any cuts in the Erasmus+ program so that¡¯s a good sign for youth at least (Valero, 2018).

This is why, in addition to the new funds at disposal through the next MFF, the Youth Guarantee should also be improved. This can be done in several ways, such as giving the strategy a more prominent place in the European semester (K?chel, 2018), or to have the Guarantee acquire real working schemes and methods. Another solution would be to increase Member States compliance by having the Commission review and monitor annually the progress, following by a naming and shaming of the ¡°bad¡± countries. Finally, for youth unemployment in general, a good multidimensional macroeconomic policies or a reform of the EMU would be necessary (Andor, ibid.); the Youth Guarantee is not a substitute to difficult reforms, it is just a non-binding instrument which probably alleviates Member States¡¯ lack of willingness to integrate further in social policies.

Conclusion

With the youth unemployment rate remaining above 30% in many European countries still today, we can see that the impacts of the financial crisis are still present. This could induce more euroscepticism in teens. Young people want more empowerment and finding good jobs faster. To tackle this problem, the Youth Guarantee that we have aforementioned seen is part of the solution. It won¡¯t fix the situation of course, but it can help, and hence the Youth Guarantee should be enhanced. More funds, more monitoring and more internal ambitious-but-realistic strategies are needed. 2018 can make this happen. We rarely needed it this much. The future of Europe¡¯s economy will be in the hands of the now-young population. Which kind of future? This depends on young people finding, or making, jobs. This depends on investing in youth.

8,"The Irish Youth Guarante

In 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee. The aim of the EU-wide Youth Guarantee, supported by central EU funding of ¢æ6 billion, is to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed.

Pilot schemes took place across Europe in 2013 including one in Ballymun, Dublin that was one of the first to receive EU funding. 

In 2014 the Irish Government expects to provide a Youth Guarantee to around 30,000 young people who are at a very high risk of long-term unemployment.It is an ambitious programme that will take time to fully implement and will require ongoing investment and sustained effort by Government, employers and jobseekers alike.  

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection coordinates the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and has many initiatives to tackle youth unemployment."
9,"Briefing paper on Youth Guarantee
The Youth Guarantee
Around 7.5 million young Europeans aged 15 to 24 years old are currently neither in employment nor in education or training (the so-called NEETs). In order to help Member States tackle these unacceptable levels of youth unemployment and social exclusion, the Commission included in its ""Youth Employment Package"", was adopted in December 2012, a proposal for a Recommendation to Member States on the introduction of a Youth Guarantee.

The Youth Guarantee aims to ensure that all young people up to the age of 25 ? whether registered with employment services or not ? receive a quality offer for a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed.

The agreement urges Member States to:

establish strong partnerships with stakeholders,
ensure early intervention by employment services and other partners supporting young people,
take supportive measures to enable labour integration,
make full use of the European Social Fund (ESF) and other structural funds to that end,
assess and continuously improve the Youth Guarantee schemes and
rapidly implement these schemes.
The Commission will support Member States through EU funding, by promoting exchanges of good practices, monitoring the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in the European Semester, and by raising awareness. EU countries are currently developing national Youth Guarantee Implementation Strategies.

To facilitate school-to-work-transitions, the package also launches a consultation of European social partners on a Quality Framework for Traineeships so as to enable young people to acquire high-quality service and work experience under safe conditions. Furthermore, it announces a European Alliance for Apprenticeships to improve the quality and supply of apprenticeships available by spreading successful apprenticeship schemes across the Member States and outlining ways to reduce obstacles to mobility for young people.

Our position
EASPD welcomes and fully supports the engagement in this field shown by the European Commission and EPSCO. Deeply concerned with the promotion of equal opportunities in the educational context and with labour market accessibility for people with disabilities, EASPD aims to improve employability and work inclusion for people with disabilities. One of our main goals is also to implement Article 27 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which includes the right to the opportunity to gain a living by work freely chosen or accepted, and equally remunerated in a labour market and work environment that is open, inclusive and accessible to all.

However, EASPD would like to express its concern over some key issues regarding the Youth Guarantee:

Young people with disabilities tend to be left behind as clear policies to help their transition from education to the labour market are absent. In addition to this, young persons with disabilities are also less likely to advance or stay in education as long as the non-disabled, leading to further structural inequalities. We expect that all programmes developed under this guarantee make provision for the real and active participation of school leavers and young people with disabilities.

Furthermore, young people with disabilities are disadvantaged by virtue of both their age and their disability: they are very likely to continue to live lives framed by structural inequality and social exclusion, unless appropriate attention and resources are focused on active inclusion. This is why it is extremely important to support them into the open labour market, also through their active inclusion in mainstream programmes such as the Youth Guarantee, Erasmus+ or Eures, if they are to contribute to the global economy.

Also, the ¢æ6 billion allocated for the programme seems largely insufficient in order to succeed in tackling youth unemployment in the EU area and is well below the ¢æ21 billion per year required for an effective Youth Guarantee according to the International Labour Organisation. The Commission and the member states should further invest in the Youth Guarantee, also by using means such as the European social fund (ESF). The current guidelines and provisions for the ESF and other structural funds and programmes should be reviewed to ensure that young persons with disabilities, including persons with intellectual/learning disabilities and mental health disorders, are not excluded and can benefit from measures aimed at their further education and inclusion in the open labour market.

European policy makers should also invest in the development of high-quality vocational education and training systems, with highly qualified teachers and trainers, innovative learning methods, high-quality infrastructure and facilities and a high labour market relevance. In addition to this, accessibility and inclusion of the education and training systems for persons with disabilities should be improved and appropriate policies and measures undertaken, as stated by Articles 24 and 27 of the UNCRPD. The Commission and the Member States must also guarantee the necessary support for young people with disabilities for the transition phase from fulltime education into work and, in case of unemployment, tailored reintegration measures should be adopted.

Moreover, European authorities and EU Member states must take into consideration a wide range of support programmes to ensure the accessibility of the Youth Guarantee for all persons with disabilities. The programme should provide equity of access for the disabled young people, guarantee an adequate income and set specific programmes in order to match the individual¡¯s needs and their type of disability. In this sense, EASPD regrets that EU programmes such as ¡®Erasmus+¡¯ and ¡®EuresJob¡¯ either do not grant extra provisions for persons with disabilities or only accord very limited ones. It is of great importance to address these issues in order to successfully guarantee equality of opportunity for young persons with disabilities.

Finally, EASPD recommends that EU Member States and regional and local authorities set up integrated territorial development strategies, including training and employment components and involve all relevant stakeholders in the design and implementation of the national, regional and local action plans, including employment services, training and education authorities, service providers, NGOs and DPOs, and student and youth organisations. The Commission and the Member States should also develop an action plan together with all relevant stakeholders, defining short-, medium and long-term measures, in order to promote sustainable and high quality youth employment, including for young people with disabilities."

Moderator:

Nicolas Vincent

 

In April 2013, EU Member States made a commitment to ensure young people's successful transition into work by establishing the Youth Guarantee scheme. 

 

The Youth Guarantee is both a structural reform to drastically improve school-to-work transitions and a measure to immediately support jobs for young people.

 

In practice, it seeks to ensure that all young people under 25 have access to a good-quality and concrete offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.

 

The 14th session of Policies & Practices looked into the Youth Guarantee more than three years after the EU recommendations, with the setting-up of a new Commission team and new challenges upfront.

 

THE YOUTH GUARANTEE RATIONALE

Ulrike Storost, team leader of the Youth Employment team at DG EMPL, opened the discussion. Ms Storost presented the rationale behind the programme: ¡°the initial idea¡±, she said, ¡°was to look beyond this traditional group of those who actually register as unemployed¡±. Embracing a wider population than the unemployed youth who officially registered was a key element of the Youth Guarantee: ¡°those who are not registered should also not be left alone for longer than four months¡±, said Ms Storost. ¡°It was and still is a major challenge.¡±

 

In a second step, the young people should be offered quality opportunities and this is where the Youth Guarantee is broader than a job scheme. Ms Storost explained the scheme provides ¡°a range of different offers that are in a way on equal footing and what is considered ¡®quality¡¯ then depends also very much on the individual.¡± Depending on the young people¡¯s profiles, it can be an offer of education for those who need to improve their skill in the first place, or an offer for a traineeship or an apprenticeship. 

 

THREE YEARS INTO THE YOUTH GUARANTEE

Ms Storost stressed the high political commitment the Youth Guarantee received right from the start. ¡°In the first years¡±, she added, ¡°there were three conferences at the level of heads of state and government really focusing on youth unemployment and on the Youth Guarantee.¡±

 

Ms Storost also highlighted the importance of key performance indicators to monitor the scheme. 

 

A second reason Ms Storost attributed to the Youth Guarantee success was the learning exchanges at the European level. 

 

As for one of the greatest challenge the Youth Guarantee faces, it is a question of funding and sustainability, particularly in 2016. ¡°It goes hand in hand with continuous political commitment¡±, noticed Ms Storost. As youth unemployment remains high in the EU, Ms Storost added that there was a 1.4 million drop in the number of unemployed youth since the Youth Guarantee recommendation¡¯s adoption. 

 

However, there still are major differences between Member States: from around 7% in Germany of youth unemployment to several countries with more than 35%?40% of youth unemployment. ¡°The figures are still too high in many countries¡±, Ms Storost acknowledged. ¡°This is the context in which we now need to keep up the political commitment and I think that's really crucial.¡±

 

POSITIVE SIDES OF THE YOUTH GUARANTEE AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS, AS SEEN BY ETUC

Youth Officer at ETUC, Ignacio Doreste was the second panelist of the session. The trade union welcomed the initiative, recalled Mr Doreste, while remaining critical. First, funding is considered by the union as being insufficient, especially ¡°in a broader framework of austerity measures, of reduction of the public deficit and of labour reforms¡±, added Mr Doreste. Knowing that only one third of the funding available has been used¡±, Mr Doreste added, reallocation of the funding, he fears, is likely to go to other initiatives that have no connection with youth employment.

 

¡°We believe¡±, Mr Doreste said, ¡°that a proper implementation and effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee should be funded by ¢æ21 billion per year¡± as recommended by the International Labour Organisation.

 

¡°It was also included in the Council recommendation¡±, Mr Doreste added, ¡°that this scheme should be designed, implemented and assessed through a partnership approach¡±, where employers, youth organisations and trade unions should be collaborating on the design and implementation of the measures. ¡°Unfortunately,¡± Mr Doreste regretted, ¡°since the moment Member States were submitting proposals to the European Commission, this partnership approach was not respected.¡±

 

ETUC wants to be considered as an ally to the European Commission: by putting pressure on governments together in order to obtain a more effective and qualitative Youth Guarantee. 

 

Mr Doreste added the Youth Guarantee does not constitute a substitute to macroeconomic instruments. The Youth Guarantee was meant to present a large array of skills whilst addressing the structural issues of the labor market. 

 

On the positive side, Mr Doreste mentioned encouraging figures: 1.3 million young people actually benefited from actions by the Youth Guarantee, with a ¢æ6.4 billion spending that is too say 2/3 (between actual expenditure and allocation of funds).. Mr Doreste noticed also that implementation was now pacing up nicely.

 

BEST PRACTICES AND INDICATORS

From the floor, Dora Husz, Team Leader at DG JUST, asked what best practices could come to the panelists¡¯ mind, especially on the issue of reaching out to specific targets usually hard to aim. Ms Storost replied that a cornerstone to success was to work with youth organisations. They help avoid the dropouts through additional mentoring and provide a longer-term follow-up. 

 

Furthermore, Ms Storost explained that there were macroeconomic indicators on youth employment and other metrics showing the participation of young people in the scheme: ¡°there are also indicators on how many of them got an offer after four months, which kind of offer, and how many actually then followed up.¡± 

 

Mr Doreste added ¡°we could share some good practices in reaching those who are more vulnerable in the labour market.¡± Mr Doreste added it is also important to identify good practices also from a qualitative point of view. 

 

PARTNERSHIP APPROACH AND THE MEMBER STATES

Bodil Agas©ªster, Director of the South Norway European Office, asked the panelists to explain the hesitation of Member States in taking forward the partnership approach. ¡°Was it because of lack of understanding of what was needed?¡±, asked Mr Agas©ªster. Mr Doreste replied that, in his view, one could put this down to limited industrial relations all across the EU, including in Member States with reputation for a constructive social dialogue.

 

QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES OF THE YOUTH GUARANTEE

Frank Dieter Fischbach, Executive Secretary of the Conference of European Churches, asked if the panelists could develop on the question of quality of employment and the type of contracts that are offered and if they could look into the question of precarious work and the working poor. ¡°To which extend this type of questions is monitored by the Commission?¡±, asked Mr Fischbach. Youth employment is more volatile, Ms Storost agreed, and some countries are overrepresented in temporary employment contracts. ¡°We look very closely at the issue¡±, Ms Storost added, such as the transition rates from temporary to permanent employment. A high dropout rate or a high rate of people coming back after a while should give an idea of what is or is not a stable employment, stable apprenticeships and this defines the quality of all these offers.

 

Ms Storost described what was considered a quality offer: ¡°if young people don't return to unemployment or inactivity six months to twelve months after¡±. Ms Storost added: ¡°An EU study of 2013 shows that there is a high rate of transitions in apprenticeships, meaning many young apprentices are taken over even by their own hosting company after finishing their apprenticeship.¡±

 

Mr Doreste praised the focus of the Commission on quality opportunities. ¡°What do we refer to when talking about a quality offer in the framework of the Youth Guarantee?¡±, he asked. Mr Doreste said it should entail the contract, a decent salary, social protection, health and safety in the workplace. 

 

Regarding traineeships, Mr Doreste praised the assessment of the European Commission regarding the quality framework for a traineeships in December 2013. ¡°It was proven that in many countries, unfortunately, traineeship are misused by companies, where they take over a real employment position¡±. Although, ¡°when it came to offer proposals in order to set into motion a framework, the proposal was rather weak¡±, Mr Doreste regretted, before adding some Member States had lobbied hard against it.

 

In the Commission¡¯s view, said Mr Doreste, ¡°any traineeship is valid as far as there is a written contract.¡± For ETUC, it is only a prerequisite to which should be added: ¡°not replacing a job, having a mentor, receiving a fee, even having social protection during that period, delivery of a training certificate.¡±

 

Dasha Bespyatova, Policy Analyst at Edenred and co-founder of InternsGoPro, asked Ms Storost what was the Commission¡¯s approach to the indicators of the skills young people have or might acquire through these opportunities. ¡°We believe that policies tackling skills are more than needed¡±, the panelist replied. The trade union movement is very involved in designing skills in the vocational school system. The Youth Guarantee includes also measures promoting skills and tackling the supply side of labour¡±, Ms Storost added.

 

Mr Doreste underlined that the current focus on reducing public expenditures was going against creating opportunities for young people. As a conclusion to the session, the ETUC representative said they were looking forward to the publication of the Commission¡¯s report on the Youth Guarantee to be published in October."
11,"Youth Guarantee: Europe Needs More Investment In Its Young People

The European Commission¡¯s decision to maintain the Youth Guarantee, the scheme launched in 2013 to offer every young person a place of education, training or employment within four months of leaving formal education or being out of work, is going in the right direction but too slowly.

The Youth Guarantee (YG) needs more funding to scale it up, better implementation to ensure high quality job and training offers, and stronger liaison with social partners, especially trade unions. The European Trade Union Confederation was alarmed to learn that out of the ¢æ6.4 billion originally invested in the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), one third has not been spent, and, according to estimates, the YG has reached only about 40% of its target group. The Commission admits that programmes started too slowly. And take-up and impact vary enormously between Member States.

In June, the ETUC demanded ¡°a strong partnership approach¡±, to involve trade unions in the development of national YG measures. According to EU Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, effective partnerships are ¡°the strongest factors of success¡±, but stakeholders have been left out and consultation with unions has been the exception, not the rule.

The Commission¡¯s meagre offer of an extra ¢æ1bn for 2017-2020, supplemented by ¢æ1bn from European Social Funds, is inadequate. According to the International Labour Organization, an effective long-term response to youth unemployment in Europe would require an investment of ¢æ21bn a year. If that seems unaffordable, just compare the cost of not acting, estimated by Eurofound as a loss to European society of ¢æ153bn in a single year, or 1.2% of EU GDP.

From a peak of 24.4% in 2013, the EU youth unemployment rate fell to 18.9% in mid-2016. The Commission celebrates the claim that over the last three years, 14 million young people have entered national YG schemes, with 1.4m fewer young unemployed and 900,000 fewer young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs). [clickToTweet tweet=¡± if there are still 18.9% of young people without work, is that the best Europe can do?¡± quote=¡±But wait: if there are still 18.9% of young people without work, and thus unable to fulfil their professional and social potential, is that the best Europe can do?¡±]

Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his State of the Union address declared that in three years the YG has brought 9m young people into work, training or an apprenticeship. But unions report that too many of these offers are short-term or unpaid internships or precarious jobs providing no security or career development. Only a few Member States have set quality criteria, and these are urgently needed. Underemployment is growing, together with bogus self-employment, zero-hours and fixed-term contracts; in countries such as Greece and the Netherlands young people are excluded from minimum wage legislation. YG schemes should be backed up by good social protection and social benefits to prevent poverty and social exclusion.

In many countries the Guarantee has been tacked onto a range of existing measures, making for uneven implementation and assessment. The commitment from employers is described by the Commission as ¡°rather limited¡±, even though the Framework of Actions on Youth Employment, adopted in June 2013 by the ETUC and employers¡¯ organisations BusinessEurope, UEAPME and CEEP, commits the parties to support the YG. They cannot complain about ¡®skills mismatches¡¯ while failing to make an effort to hire and train young people. Employer involvement is vital to matching young people¡¯s skills to labour market vacancies.

Helping NEETs should remain a YG priority. The NEET rate has fallen by just 1.2% since 2012, and remains well above the pre-crisis 2008 level of 10.9%. Only 57% of NEETs are registered with public employment services ? a key access point to the YG ? and young women are especially vulnerable. NEET populations vary greatly in different Member States. All this requires complex policy responses tailored to specific needs.

Our findings are backed up by the European Policy Centre. In a report published in September, it compared YG schemes in five different EU regions in Belgium, Slovakia, Italy and the UK. It found ¡°undeniable weaknesses¡±, including ¡°insufficient efforts to reach out to the non-registered NEETs¡±, and urged more support for the most vulnerable such as young migrants.

There is no ¡°magic formula¡± for integrating young people into the labour market overnight. The YG alone cannot solve the whole problem of youth unemployment in Europe. But with the objective of guaranteeing every young European the right to guidance when becoming unemployed or entering the labour market, the EU should play its part in fighting unemployment. This requires time, commitment and genuine investment in Europe¡¯s future: exactly what the Youth Guarantee needs too."
12,"Youth Guarantee

NYCI Policy Position

NYCI calls on Government to review current implementation of the Youth Guarantee and set out ambitious targets for delivery of the initiative from 2016-2020
NYCI was among the first organisations to call for the introduction of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland in 2011.  We welcomed the decision of Government to support a Youth Guarantee and their leadership during the Irish EU Presidency in delivering an EU Council recommendation. This recommended that member states guarantee a quality offer of an education, training and/or work experience opportunity to young people who were unemployed for four months or more. We also supported the delivery of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot which ended in December 2014 and which has been positively evaluated. In January 2014 the Government published a National Implementation Plan in order to draw down EU funds for 2014 and 2015.

While we accept the initiative would be phased in over time we are disappointed with the pace of implementation to date. According to the plan the Government was supposed to deliver 28,500 education, training and work experience places in 2014. However, the most recent data from May 2015 https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2015-05-28a.174&s=%22pilot+scheme%22+section%3Awrans#g175.q

 indicates that only 23,313 places were provided.

Also we are concerned that only 9,073 young jobseekers https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2015-07-07a.189&s=%22personal+progression+plan%22+section%3Awrans%20-%20g190.q have completed a personal progression plan which is an integral part of the Youth Guarantee.

We are concerned that there is a view that a recovering economy will by itself solve this problem. Some young people will not be able to access the employment available without the education and training promised under the Youth Guarantee. However it is not simply an issue of quantity, the education and training must be of good quality, appropriate to the jobseeker and relevant to the labour market. Too often in the past jobseekers were sent on training courses solely to meet the needs of training providers to fill places. These practices demoralize jobseekers and are a waste of time and money. We need to provide high quality training that responds to the needs of both the jobseekers and the local employers. 

Therefore we are calling on the next Government to review the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and to set out ambitious targets for the delivery of the Youth Guarantee from 2016-2020."
13,"New Youth Guarantee report on innovative approaches to reach out to young people

The European Commission has recently released the new Youth Guarantee report,  highlighting concrete practices to improve the outreach to young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs). The report is aimed at drawing out lessons learned and challenges starting from the first five years of implementation of the EC Youth Guarantee programme.

The report ? titled ¡°Effective outreach to NEETs: Experience from the ground¡± -identifies three main key success factors:

having a strategic approach and flexibility in implementation;
taking a preventative approach and thus early intervention;
tailoring strategies and services to young people¡¯s needs.
The Youth Guarantee is a commitment by all Member States to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship and traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education, proving to be a well-established tool to fight youth unemployment in Europe.

Despite the good results of the framework, many Member States still struggle to reach out to all young people needing support: currently, fewer than 40% of NEETs in the EU are registered with their national Youth Guarantee provider. In particular, young people with disadvantaged backgrounds, such as migrants, young people with disabilities, or those with caring responsibilities, are underrepresented among Youth Guarantee beneficiaries.

Additionally, from 2016 to 2018 the Commission financed nine projects on information sharing and outreach activities to young people about Youth Guarantee offers. The projects have led to nation-wide outreach campaigns, outreach events as well as websites and mobile applications to register for the Youth Guarantee online.

Eurodiaconia is also active on training opportunities for young people: over the last one year and a half, our network has led an Erasmus+ project ? ¡°Empower You(the)!¡± ? focused on sharing innovative youth methods and models implemented by six members of our network. An Online Toolkit containing the project¡¯s most innovative findings was published as the main outcome and was also included in the SALTO-YOUTH Toolbox, a collection of European youth work materials selected by a network of six Resource Centres working under the Erasmus+ programme. "
14,"The European Youth Guarantee ? lessons learned and future
The third session will discuss the European Youth Guarantee ? Lessons learned and future. Irene Dingeldey, University of Bremen (Germany) will discuss how the EU could ensure continuity into youth unemployment policies in times of ongoing changing labour market.

Addressed in the NEGOTIATE policy brief on the ¡®Coordination of European strategies to tackle early job insecurity and youth unemployment: Lessons from a comparative study¡¯, the situation of the young unemployed has become an increasing concern of national governments and the European Union (EU) after the financial crisis. Hence, in 2013 the Council launched the Recommendation on the Youth Guarantee (YG) and the Member States made a commitment to ensure that young people under 25 years ¡°receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education¡±. NEGOTIATE has been researching the implementation of this guarantee as a policy strategy because it is innovative due to its clear objective and provides dedicated financial resources for youth employment policy through the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).

According to the researchers it is paramount for Member States to facilitate their national institutions to better support their young people systematically during their transition into the labour market. Especially the national capacity of the public employment services with regards to its financing and human resources is in need of strengthening by also offering a more qualitative support to youth in local employment offices. Hence, further (financial) support and guidance is required at national level, to implement measures such as one-stop shops or work experience placements. Social partners and other stakeholder need to be included in the design and monitoring of the youth employment measures. Additionally, Vocational Education and Training (VET) systems play an important role to bring together the demands of employers and the needs of young apprentices while safeguarding the quality of both work and education, as well as fair wages. Thus, efforts of member states to build such institutions are appreciated.

The EU should aim at facilitating the exchange of ideas on youth employment policy at Member State level and remove bureaucratic obstacles. As for the European Semester, it should monitor the progress made on national level through the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans (YGIP) and its country specific goal-setting on a more qualitative basis and enhancing models of good practice.

Here you can find the latest programme of the conference."
15,"What is the Youth Guarantee?

The objective of the youth guarantee is to help young people gain access to education and employment. Successful execution of the youth guarantee requires cooperation among national and municipal authorities, the business sector and organisations.

Methods of implementing the guarantee include measures related to the educational guarantee, the skills programme for young adults, employment and economic development services for youth (PES) and rehabilitation services, including municipal social and health care services and other individual services for young people, such as youth outreach work and youth workshop activities.

One of the principles of the youth guarantee is that young people are heard and allowed to influence the course of their life. The youth guarantee supports growth, emancipation and life management of young people.

The objective of the youth guarantee is to support young people in gain in a place in education and employment, to prevent prolonged youth unemployment, to identify factors contributing to the risk of social exclusion and to offer support at an early stage, in order to prevent social exclusion and marginalisation of young people."

Youth guarantee
EU governments must deliver and tackle disturbing youth unemployment
The European Parliament today adopted a resolution on the proposed Youth Employment Package, which includes a youth guarantee scheme. The Greens have been strongly pushing for EU measures to address the high levels of youth unemployment in Europe and have been advocating a youth guarantee scheme from the outset (1). The resolution adopted today, which was drafted by the Greens, aims to ensure EU governments swiftly follow-up on the youth guarantee proposals, which have been proposed by the European Commission. Commenting after the vote, Greens/EFA vice-president and employment spokesperson Emilie Turunen (MEP, Denmark) said:

""EU governments must stop sitting on their hands and must finally act to address the disturbing levels of youth unemployment in a number of EU member states. The proposed European youth guarantee scheme is a concrete measure that would provide an EU-wide approach to tackling this transnational problem and EU governments must deliver on the proposal without delay.

""The Greens have been to the fore in advocating a binding youth guarantee to address the problem of youth unemployment (1). With crisis-hit EU member states those most affected by rocketing youth unemployment, EU support is essential. The 7.5 million young people in the EU currently not in employment, education or training need to be given some kind of perspective and the youth guarantee does just that. In particular, the targeting of EU structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund, with view to providing concrete measures, such as training schemes, is an essential measure.""

18,"The youth guarantee is now a reality >> Join our upgraded campaign for a Youth Plan

The youth guarantee campaign was a success and this guarantee is now a reality.

However, youth unemployment is still an issue in Europe and there is much to do to improve young people's chances at a better future.

In this sense, we have launched the Youth Plan campaign, calling for:

a permanent youth guarantee to be extended to people until 30 years old
an extended Erasmus programme that includes vocational and high-school students
culture cheques to provide access to young people to culture
a child guarantee: access to free healthcare, free education, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition

The youth guarantee campaign 5.7 million young people are currently unemployed in Europe and an additional 1.5 million are forced into precarious jobs. In some countries as many as one young person out of two cannot find a job.

The campaign ¡°Your future is my future ? a European Youth Guarantee now¡± is calling for a European Youth Guarantee as a way to tackle youth unemployment.
What is the European Youth Guarantee?
The European Youth Guarantee is a guarantee that ensures that every young person in Europe is offered a job, further education or work-focused training at the latest four months after leaving education or after becoming unemployed.
It can be implemented at European or at national level. "
19,"Youth Guarantee: youth unemployment must be tackled but doubts on financing remain

""The EPP Group welcomes the so-called 'Youth Guarantee' proposed by the European Commission. This tool could be a major step in the fight against the alarming levels of youth unemployment in the European Union. However, reservations still remain about the financing of the proposed instrument"", said Csaba ?ry MEP, EPP Group Coordinator in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

Today, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on the so-called 'Youth Guarantee', presented by the European Commission in December in its long-awaited Youth Employment Package, aimed at tackling the unprecedented levels of youth unemployment.

""We welcome this important proposal from the European Commission, especially in light of the worrying unemployment rates among the European youth. There is no disagreement that we need to tackle unemployment and place special focus on youth employment. Youth unemployment has reached record levels in the EU and is causing significant economic costs for Member States, not to mention the long-term social consequences. The EPP Group has thus supported the Motion for Resolution adopted today in plenary calling for the implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes"", said Csaba ?ry.

""However, the EPP Group still has reservations about the financing of such an instrument at Member-State level, especially in the face of the recent uncertainties about the new Multiannual Financial Framework. All 27 Member States face different challenges in the field of youth unemployment, requiring special, tailored solutions"", he said.

""I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the cohesion funds, in this field particularly, the European Social Fund. These funds should remain untouched and should be used for concrete projects. Funds for real job creation should not be diverted"", added Csaba ?ry.

The EPP Group Coordinator in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee concluded: ""The EPP Group puts job creation first in tackling unemployment. The key to reaching that goal is to generate economic growth via responsible budgetary and smart investment policies.""

Background: The unemployment rate in the EU is rising steadily and has reached the unprecedented level of 10.8%. Recent Eurostat data shows that more than 26 million people are without jobs. The youth unemployment rate has also soared to 23.4%, leaving 5.68 million young out of the labour market. Youth unemployment is especially worrying in southern Member States. In Italy, it has risen to some 35% and in Spain and Greece it even goes over 50%."
20,"EU Youth Guarantee: Questions and Answers
Met dank overgenomen van Europese Commissie (EC), gepubliceerd op woensdag 4 februari 2015.
What is the Youth Guarantee?

In April 2013, EU Member States made a commitment to ensure young people's successful transition into work by establishing Youth Guarantee schemes.

Under the Youth Guarantee Member States should ensure that, within four months of leaving school or losing a job, young people under 25 can either find a good-quality job suited to their education, skills and experience; or acquire the education, skills and experience required to find a job in the future through an apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education.

The Youth Guarantee is both a structural reform to drastically improve school-to-work transitions and a measure to immediately support jobs for young people.

The Youth Guarantee is based on successful experience in Austria and Finland that show that investing in school-to-work transitions for young people pays off. The Finnish Youth Guarantee helped to reduce unemployment amongst young people, with 83.5% successfully allocated a job, traineeship, apprenticeship or further education within three months of registering.

The Youth Guarantee Recommendation was formally adopted by the EU's Council of Ministers on 22 April 2013 (see MEMO/13/152) on the basis of a proposal made by the Commission in December 2012 (see IP/12/1311 and MEMO/12/938) and was endorsed by the June 2013 European Council.

The G20 considers the Youth Guarantee a new major reform for youth employment. The meeting of G20 Labour Ministers in Melbourne on 10-11 September 2014 decided that more should be done to implement G20 strategies, notably the youth guarantees, and committed to take concrete actions to place young people in education, training and jobs.

How serious a problem is youth unemployment and inactivity in the EU?

Around 5 million young people (under 25) were unemployed in the EU-28 area in December 2014, of whom over 3.2 million were in the euro area.

- 
This represents an unemployment rate of 21.4% in the EU (23% in the euro area). More than one in five young Europeans on the labour market cannot find a job; in Greece and Spain it is one in two. 7.5 million young Europeans between 15 and 24 are not employed, not in education and not in training (NEETs).
- 
In the last four years, the overall employment rates for young people fell three times as much as for adults.
- 
The gap between the countries with the highest and the lowest jobless rates for young people is extremely high. There is a gap of 44 percentage points between the Member State with the lowest rate of youth unemployment (Germany at 7.2% in December 2014) and the Member State with the highest rate, Spain (51.4% in December 2014). Spain is followed by Greece (50.6% in October 2014), Croatia (44.8% in the fourth quarter 2014) and Italy (42% in December 2014).
Youth unemployment and NEETs indicators are part of the new Scoreboard of key employment and social indicators which identifies the major employment and social imbalances within the EU (see IP/13/893). The first such Scoreboard was published as part of the Joint Employment Report 2014, jointly adopted by the Commission and the EU's Council of Ministers. It is composed of five key indicators and forms the basis of the Commission's annual country-specific recommendations, where it proposes reforms to support job creation, strengthen the resilience of labour markets and address poverty and social inclusion.

Have Member States already started to implement the Youth Guarantee?

Yes. Implementation of the Youth Guarantee has started in all Member States and is already bringing results. Compared to other structural reforms in Europe, the Youth Guarantee is probably one of the most rapidly implemented.

All Member States have presented comprehensive Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans, complying with the deadlines set by the European Council. The Plans identify precisely, in each Member State, the measures to be taken to implement the Youth Guarantee. They outline the timeframe for youth employment reforms and measures, the respective roles of public authorities and other organisations, and how it will be financed. Details of Member State's plans are available here.

These Plans and their implementation have been assessed by the Commission within the context of the European Semester - the EU's reinforced economic surveillance framework (see here). Multilateral surveillance reviews are also taking place on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.

To underpin Youth Guarantee schemes with credible data, and enable support monitoring and continuous improvement, the Employment Committee developed an Indicator Framework for Monitoring the Youth Guarantee, which received political support from the Ministers of Employment at EPSCO Council on 11 December 2014. Annual data collection should start in 2015.

How does the Youth Guarantee encourage reforms in the Member States?

For most Member States, implementing the Youth Guarantee requires in-depth structural reforms of training, job-search and education systems to drastically improve the transition from school to work and the employability of young people. This cannot be delivered overnight.

In some Member States, public employment services (PES) must be reformed to ensure individual young people receive appropriate personalised advice on the job, education and training opportunities most relevant to their own situation, resulting in a tailor-made, concrete offer within four months. The Decision to help public employment services to maximise their effectiveness through closer cooperation, proposed by the Commission in June 2013 and adopted in May 2014, can play a useful role here (see IP/13/544 and IP/14/545).

Another area requiring structural reforms concerns improving the quality and quantity of apprenticeships, vocational education and training opportunities. Member States must ensure that they give young people the skills that employers are looking for.

Most of the Member States should also identify and activate those furthest away from the labour market (NEETs). In order to reach inactive young people who are not registered with the Public Employment Service, Member States should establish new tools and strategies with all those who have access to these unregistered young people (e.g. social services, education providers, youth associations.).

Precisely because the Youth Guarantee aims at structural reform, the Commission proposed specific recommendations on implementing the Youth Guarantee to several countries (Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Croatia, Portugal, Poland, Bulgaria and Ireland) in 2014. Full details of the Commission's review of all Member States' implementation of the Youth Guarantee as part of the European Semester are available here.

These steps include active labour market policies, reinforcing public employment services, supporting training and apprenticeship schemes, combating early school leaving, and setting up outreach strategies, all of which can contribute to delivering the Youth Guarantee. The Recommendations also urged Member States to tackle the segmentation of labour markets where young people are much more vulnerable.

The draft Joint Employment Report 2015 highlights that the Youth Guarantee drove long-term reforms in many of these areas.

Are there any good examples of concrete and positive results from implementing the Youth Guarantee?

In Belgium, the public employment service in the Brussels region, Actiris, set up a dedicated Youth Guarantee service, to provide specific support in finding jobs and internships to young people officially registered as jobseekers. According to Actiris, (in August 2014), the number of young people (under 25 years of age) looking for work in Brussels dropped as a result of the Youth Guarantee strategy.

In Romania, 27 youth guarantee centres (currently supported by the European Social Fund) were created. These centres aim at identifying young NEETs and offering them integrated packages of personalised services.

Spain has taken further steps to implement the National Youth Guarantee System based on Royal Decree-Law 8/2014 of 4 July. This Law regulates the registration procedure for the Youth Guarantee and fixes eligibility criteria for the beneficiaries. Furthermore, additional non-wage recruitment subsidies for indefinite and training contracts specifically addressed to those registered in the Youth Guarantee were adopted. And as of 5 August 2014, young people registered in the national Youth Guarantee system can use four online training courses free of charge. The Spanish Public Employment Service also launched a call for proposals with a total budget of almost ¢æ42 million for professional training activities and training in ICT and language courses to be developed at central level for young people registered in the Youth Guarantee system.

In Italy, the set-up of integrated e-Portals allows people to register directly on-line and be connected to a national register to facilitate automatic verification of fulfilment of requirements, and transmission of offers.

Slovakia proposed a number of legislative reforms to implement the YG (VET, non-formal education, ALMPs). There are 4 ongoing national projects supporting employment of young unemployed under 29. Until 31 August 2014, in total 12,532 new jobs were created for young jobseekers under 29. A new contribution to job placement in a first paid employment (open-ended contract) in case of recruitment of jobseekers under 24 and jobseekers (25-29) looking for job longer than 6 months (Act on Employment Services is being amended), will start in January 2015.

Targeted hiring incentives and start-up subsidies have been also means to promote the activation of young jobseekers in some Member States: The Netherlands adopted a tax rebate for employers hiring young people who receive unemployment benefits or social assistance for a period up to two years, whereas Poland introduced exemptions from social insurance contributions for under-30-year olds.

Most Member States took measures to improve their vocational education and training systems (VET)to better reflect the needs of the labour market in general linked to their Youth Guarantee scheme and commitments taken under the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. Several countries introduced legislative revisions of their VET systems.

Spain developed its dual training system with immediate results already visible: Number of VET centres involved in dual VET projects increased from 172 in 2013 to 375 in 2014. Number of companies involved in dual VET projects from 513 in 2013 to 1570 in 2014 and students from 4,292 in 2013 to 9,555 in 2014.

In France, the new law on lifelong learning and VET increases support for apprenticeships for those with fewer qualifications. Romania launched new legislation to provide subsidized professional stages for higher education graduates. Sweden has adopted measures to facilitate the transition from school to work via apprenticeships, and help young people get work experience. In Portugal, the curricular pattern of vocational education and training was adapted and Portugal created a vocational centres network and new vocational courses at basic (age 14) and secondary (ages 15 to 17) education. In Denmark the reform of vocational education and training was adopted in June 2014 and is to take effect from the school year 2015/16. The reform is to contribute to ensuring that more young people complete a VET programme, and contribute to ensuring education guarantee in Denmark for all young people who want basic vocational education and training.

In addition, 18 small scale pilot projects for the Youth Guarantee were launched between August and December 2013 with the support of the European Commission. They were each running for around 12 months (see IP/14/981 and MEMO/14/521) in seven countries (Ireland, Italy, Lithuania,Poland,Romania,Spain andthe United Kingdom). One of the pilot projects - the project in Ballymun, Ireland - supports approx. 1000 young people and is testing the effectiveness of a new local partnership approach, which will feed into the review of the Irish national Youth Guarantee scheme.

The Youth Guarantee costs money - does it pay off?

The International Labour Organisation has estimated the cost of setting up Youth Guarantees in the Eurozone at ¢æ21 billion per year. However, the costs of NOT acting are far higher. The European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) has estimated the economic loss in the EU of having millions of young people out of work, education or training at over ¢æ150 billion in 2011 (1.2% of EU GDP), in terms of benefits paid out and lost output.

This is in addition to the long-term costs of unemployment to the economy, to society and to the individuals concerned, such as increased risk of future unemployment and poverty. The cost of doing nothing is therefore very high: the Youth Guarantee scheme is an investment. For the Commission, this is crucial expenditure for the EU to preserve its future growth potential. Significant EU financial support can help - most notably from the European Social Fund and in the context of the Youth Employment Initiative (see below). But to make the Youth Guarantee a reality, Member States also need to prioritise youth employment measures in their national budgets.

Is the Youth Guarantee also helping job creation in the short term?

In addition to ""supply-side"" measures such as activation through job search guidance or training courses, the Youth Guarantee encourages the use of a wide range of proactive measures helping to boost ""demand"" for young people's labour. These measures, such as temporary and well-targeted wage or recruitment subsidies or apprenticeship and traineeship grants, may often be necessary in order to successfully integrate young people into the labour market. They should be therefore viewed as social investment which enables young people to put their skills to productive use and to further develop them, as opposed to the skills deterioration and de-motivation which results from protracted unemployment and inactivity.

Making good use of ""demand-side"" measures is very important if we want to make a real impact in terms of reducing today's high levels of youth unemployment and economic inactivity.

Would it not be better to directly support enterprises to create jobs for young people?

Jobs and growth are top priorities for the European Commission. The Juncker Commission has presented an ambitious Investment Plan for Europe mobilising more than EUR 315 billion of additional financing in strategic areas. A significant amount should be channelled towards projects that can help get the younger generation back to work in decent jobs, further complementing the efforts of the Youth Guarantee Scheme. The Commission is also supporting structural reforms at national level that can unlock job creation.

One of the reasons companies cannot employ more youngsters is that young people lack the skills and experience relevant to companies' requirements. Another reason is that even if young people do have the relevant skills and experience sought by employers, public employment services in many Member States are not effective at matching them with companies looking for people with such skills and experience. Supporting companies to create jobs for young people is of course very important and many initiatives have been put in place by the Commission (such as the COSME programme and business development support from the European Structural and Investment Funds) and the European Investment Bank Group.

Can the Youth Guarantee deliver more jobs for young people if economic growth is slow?

The Youth Guarantee is no substitute for the use of macroeconomic instruments, nor for the pursuit of structural reforms, but it can help to make the economic recovery job-rich and it makes a systemic difference in improving school-to-work transitions. This is why the EUR 315 billion Investment Plan to promote jobs and growht in Europe is one of the main priorities of this Commission.

Youth unemployment is more sensitive to the economic cycle than overall unemployment as young people are less experienced, often employed through short-term contracts and thus more easily laid off and they are also more concentrated in economic sectors more exposed to economic downturns, such as manufacturing, construction, retail or the hospitality sector. Evidence from the past 15-20 years shows that the overall unemployment rate in the EU can only be expected to fall if annual GDP grows by more than 1.5 per cent on average. Reduction in the youth unemployment rate normally requires even slightly higher GDP growth rates.

On the contrary, if economic growth remains below 1.5% per year, youth unemployment rates tend to rise faster than overall the unemployment rate. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cyclical factors explain about 50 per cent of the changes in youth unemployment rates across Europe and 70 per cent in stressed euro area countries.[1]

However, the levels of youth unemployment are also influenced by structural characteristics of labour markets, such as hiring costs or the existence of active labour market policies, as well as by the quality of education and training systems. This is where a comprehensive Youth Guarantee can make a big difference, ultimately leading to a decrease in the wide gap between youth unemployment and overall unemployment rates.

How do the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative support the implementation of the Youth Guarantee?

By far the most important source of EU money to support implementation of the Youth Guarantee and other measures to tackle youth unemployment is the European Social Fund (ESF) worth around EUR 86 billion for the 2014-2020 period.

Implementation of the Youth Guarantee is identified as a high priority in the Partnership Agreements. The Commission has adopted such agreements for all Member States. These agreements set the strategic framework for the implementation of the European Structural and Investment Funds in the 2014-20 period in each Member State.

The Youth Employment Initiative is an additional source of funding to boost the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in the coming months and years."
21,"The Youth Guarantee
The Youth Guarantee means that the TE services will offer an unemployed young person a service or a measure at the latest three months after he or she becomes a jobseeker. These services will improve the young person's possibilities of being successful in the job market and finding a job.

The Youth Guarantee

promotes access to education, training and the job market
prevents prolonged unemployment
prevents exclusion.
Draw up an employment plan at the TE Office
If you are under 25 years old, or a recently graduated person aged 25?29, and registered as a jobseeker with the TE Office, you will draw up an employment plan together with the office. The plan will contain services that will help you find a job.

Before you have been unemployed for three months, the TE Office will offer you one of the following

work
education or training
a work try-out
job search training
a startup grant
work on a pay subsidy, or
vocational guidance and career planning services.
If you remain unemployed for a longer period, the TE Office will be actively offering you services throughout this period. 
Read also: Employment plan

Apply for education or training
In the youth guarantee system, young people are also expected to be active themselves.

For example, you must apply for education or training that leads to a qualification and imparts vocational skills in the spring, even if your are currently taking part in a work try-out or using some other service. Otherwise a sanction laid down in the Act on  unemployment security may apply to you.

To whom does the Youth Guarantee apply?
The Youth Guarantee applies to

all those under 25 years of age
young people aged under 30 who have graduated within the last 12 months and who are registered with the TE Office as jobseekers.
The Youth Guarantee applies to young people regardless of whether or not they have completed vocational education and training.

The Youth Guarantee can also be implemented by directing the young person to a service other than those provided by the public employment services as indicated in the employment plan. For example, a young person can be directed to the municipal social and health care services if necessary."
22,"Impact of the economic crisis on youth - the Youth Guarantee a new approach to tackling youth unemployment

On 16 November 2016 from 12:30-14:30 SOLIDAR Foundation together with NOVA-Norwegian Social Research are hosting a lunch-time discussion on the on the impact of the economic crisis on youth, and how it determinates the degree of early job insecurities. The event will take place in the new premises of SOLIDAR at Rue de la Pascale 4-6, 1040 Brussels.

The situation of young people is becoming harder, and harder. There are about 40 million young people in Europe who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs), where 40% of them has experienced a period of inactivity and unemployment, what influences a risk of social exclusion and impacts the future of a young person. Policy makers should provide youth with adequate support, and measures such as the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative to support young people in finding decent jobs.

Since the outbreak of the crisis in Croatia, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Spain and Czech Republic the probability of losing a job and becoming unemployed has increased significantly. Only the situation of youth in Luxembourg and Switzerland has improved in this regard. However, as data shows, the probability of finding a job has also decreased in the same countries, as well as in Romania, Slovakia, and Sweden. NEGOTIATE research shows that in the majority of countries, young individuals are less likely to exit unemployment. At the same time, have lower chances of finding a job when they are unemployed in comparison with the chances that they had before the beginning of the crisis.

At this meeting you will have a chance to get acquainted with the first findings from the research project NEGOTIATE that is examining the long- and short-term consequences of job insecurity and labour market exclusion of young people. This Horizon 2020 research project intents, on the basis of the study on the position of young people in the labour market, to contribute with its research to the development of evidence-based and effective policies preventing the adverse effects of early job insecurity and youth unemployment.

With this meeting we wish to bring together policy makers, researchers, youth, trade unions, and other stakeholders to look at measures such as the Youth Guarantee and discuss approaches to tackle youth unemployment and improve youth¡¯s decent position on the labour market."
23,"The EU Youth Guarantee: A ¡°Lost Generation¡±?

Is the Youth Guarantee enough to get unemployed Europeans out of poverty?

Leaders in Europe and around the world are hoping the worst of the economic and financial crisis is over and that 2014 will be a year of recovery.

However, when it comes to youth unemployment in the European Union (EU), there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel, save for a few exceptions. Youth unemployment has been on a continuous rise since the beginning of the crisis five years ago and, according to Eurostat (the European Commission¡¯s Directorate providing statistical information), it has now reached an average of 23.5%.

More specifically, there has been an increase of the ¡°NEETs,¡± young people who are not in employment, education or training. According to Eurofound ? tasked with improving living and working conditions ? as many as 14 million young Europeans fall into this category.

Long-Term Effects

The problem has been particularly acute in the European ¡°Southern belt¡± ? Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Croatia ? where roughly one in two young people are without a job. Many of the new Eastern European members, including Romania and Bulgaria, also face difficult youth unemployment problems.

In truth, the information produced by Eurostat does not provide a complete picture. First, it only takes into account people aged between 15-24, leaving out many youngsters that entered the job market during the economic crisis.

Moreover, many young Europeans are underemployed, holding jobs they feel overqualified for or working under precarious contracts such as internships, which are often unpaid or grossly underpaid.

Apart from the alarming size of the phenomenon, it is clear that youth unemployment will have a long-term effect on a big segment of the EU population. In this regard, many speak of ¡°a lost generation¡± that will bear the scars of the crisis long after it ends. In addition to the immediate economic consequences, they will suffer in numerous other ways.

For example, according to the World Economic Forum¡¯s ¡°Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014,¡± a generation that starts its career in complete hopelessness will be more vulnerable to populist politics and will lack the fundamental skills one develops early on in a career.

This generation will also have a higher chance of suffering from unemployment and poverty later on, which could lead to higher rates of crime.

Furthermore, countries with the highest rates of youth unemployment suffer from a ¡°brain drain,¡± in which educated youngsters leave the country to try and find work abroad. Not only are these countries losing a motivated workforce, but all the money invested in its education has also been wasted.

The Youth Guarantee

Within the context of its social policies and the promotion of the movement of workers and their full employment, the EU has supported youth employment since long before the outbreak of the crisis. The main instrument of this support is the European Social Fund (ESF) ? a structural fund investing around 10% of the EU budget in creating more and better jobs within the European Union.

According to the European Commission, from 2007 to 2012, 20 million young people under 25 benefitted from the ESF through training or mentoring. Many member states use ESF to modernize education and strengthen vocational training.

As a new targeted policy, the European Council endorsed the principle of the Youth Guarantee in June 2013, which was hailed by the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion as ¡°the most ambitious reform yet¡± to tackle youth unemployment.

Under this scheme, member states are to offer all young people up to the age of 25 a good quality employment opportunity, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving their formal education or becoming unemployed. The Youth Guarantee is based on the model of earlier national plans that were successfully implemented in Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Poland.

As it has been noted, youth guarantee schemes create entitlements to certain measures for all parts of a population within a certain age group. The principal supportive measures of the initiative would consist of building up partnership-based approaches, early intervention and activation, and supportive measures for labor market integration.

Partnership-Based Approaches

This part of the program focuses on the actors that are to be involved in helping young job seekers. In order to work, the Youth Guarantee needs the full cooperation of national and regional authorities, as well as public employment services and participants from businesses and the third sector.

There will also need to be a public authority in charge of coordinating partnerships across all levels and sectors. Building partnerships will not be an easy task, as the situation within EU member states is characterized by a wide range of actors involved with combating youth employment. This includes an increasing presence of grassroots campaigns, such as the Gera??o ? Rasca in Portugal, No nos vamos, nos echan in Spain, and the Giovani Italiani Bruxelles ? a watchdog of European and Italian policies to combat youth unemployment.

Early Intervention and Activation

The Youth Guarantee will support activities aimed at engaging and registering job seekers early on. This will include support for public employment services that should interact on a more regular basis with the schools.

There is also an emphasis on creating focal points that will ensure coordination between all groups concerned and the public authority responsible for managing the initiative. Providing people outside the system with information is also essential, and increasing the use of Internet and social media will be promoted.

Supportive Measures for Labor Market Integration

Perhaps most important to the success of the Youth Guarantee will be the steps taken to encourage a proper integration of youngsters into the labor market. One of the biggest issues, in many of the countries with the highest levels of youth unemployment, has been the apparent mismatch between the skills and competencies provided in education and those required by the labor market.

To give an example, the Italian high school system still places an emphasis on the study of Latin, whilst it ranks second to last in the EF English Proficiency Index amongst EU countries (with France ranking the lowest).

Apart from the provision of language training, which appears essential to enhance job mobility in the EU, the Youth Guarantee will support the acquisition of practical capabilities such as ICT and digital skills, which have been identified as one of the key sectors of growth in the labor market.

Moreover, many European countries have an insider-outsider labor market in which older people have permanent, often almost ¡°untouchable¡± positions.

In Italy, for example, employers claim an important article of the workers¡¯ statute, which dates from 1970, makes it very hard to fire workers and has promoted economic stagnation. Since the associated costs of hiring are so high, many companies have preferred to hire more experienced professionals, or sometimes to postpone the hiring process rather than spending time and capital on young talent as a long-term investment.

In order to help reverse these trends, the Youth Guarantee promotes wage and recruitment subsidies to encourage young people with an apprenticeship or job placement.

Some Critical Considerations

Part of the issue has been that European austerity measures are geared to promote healthy growth in the long-term, but have prevented spending by governments in the short-term.

Many European leaders find themselves having to both implement these difficult reforms and ensure their electorate remains content in order to avoid political instability. Often, there are tradeoffs that need to be made, and so far the young generation, which is frequently numerically smaller, has been chiefly on the losing end.

For example, Spain¡¯s austerity budget in 2013 included new spending cuts, yet an increase in pensions using ¢æ3 billion of reserve funds.

The Youth Guarantee will provide a mechanism in which member states can take measures to tackle youth unemployment and receive money through the ESF; however, the extent to which they take advantage of this will ultimately be left to them.

Considering the crisis started over five years ago, it is important for member states to move as fast and efficiently as possible ? also since there are age restrictions involved.

To increase available EU financial support for youth unemployment, the EU has also created a dedicated Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), which will provide ¢æ6 billion for regions experiencing youth unemployment rates above 25%.

The YEI will exclusively target NEETs aged up to 25 years but, where the member states consider it relevant, also those aged up to 30. In this case, however, member states will have to allocate additional ESF resources.

Many European countries have educational and societal systems in which students finish their tertiary studies after the age of 25. Part of the danger of trying to implement plans that worked in northern European countries in southern states such as Greece, Italy and Spain is that local considerations are not taken into account.

In Italy, for example, the average student finishes high school at age 19 and will usually graduate from higher education (first and second level) after the age of 25. For this reason, it would seem like a good idea to expand the application of the Youth Guarantee scheme to all people under the age of 30 automatically.

Furthermore, considering the EU recently approved a budget (multiannual financial framework) of ¢æ908 billion for the period 2014-2020, it appears the amount being allocated for the Youth Guarantee and other young employment initiatives is too small, consisting of ¢æ3 billion from a new line dedicated to youth employment matched by ¡°at least¡± ¢æ3 billion from the ESF national allocations.

Although the European economy is no longer in the privileged geopolitical position it was after World War II, it still benefits from a highly educated population, high-quality outputs and the world¡¯s largest trading block. In order to compete in an increasingly interconnected world, it will be necessary for the EU to coordinate its actions, stand together and implement best practices.

Nowhere does this seem more relevant than regarding its youth. Although the Youth Guarantee is a welcomed step in the right direction, it will be mostly up to EU member states to give the initiative the necessary impetus.

With the European Parliament election and the reshuffling of the EC expected for 2014, it seems like no better moment for EU representatives to step up their efforts to tackle youth unemployment as well."
24,"The conference consisted in a series or panels with key note speakers from the different stakeholders involved on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee: member states and its employment services, regional and local governments, companies, trade unions and the youth sector. We could get updated information on which stage the different member states are now, and what are some of the challenges they are facing.
AEGEE-Europe is happy to see that the Member States are working hard to implement this innovative approach to reduce the impact of the crisis on Youth Employment as soon as possible. However, if only an ambitious plan is essential to tackle effectively youht unemployment, this conference has shown that we are still far from a fully-fledged and successful implementation of the Youth Guarantee:

 

There are still some countries who did not submit the Implementation Plans to the European Commission yet;
The money made available from the European Union, through the European Social Fund, is not enough to put into practice an effective Youth Guarantee. Member States should cover the rest without any delay, since the ILO study proved that the costs of inactivity will be higher than the amount to be invested;
In most countries, the involvement of the youth sector in the development of the implementation plans has been very limited, and in many cases inexistent. This contradicts the Council Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee, which explicitly mentioned that Member States should ¡°ensure the consultation or involvement of young people and/or youth organisations in designing and further developing the Youth Guarantee scheme¡±.
We encourage all countries to extend the age range of potential beneficiaries to 30 years, to reflect the reality of society and include in the Youth Guarantee those young Europeans who finish their studies in their late twenties.
We believe the Youth Guarantee has a big potential to contribute to the solution of the Youth Unemployment crisis in Europe, but the success of this initiative will depend much on the ownership the Member States take from it. It should not stay a European initiative, but countries and regions have to invest on it and include all actors on the process. The youth sector, through the National Youth Councils and other big youth platforms, can contribute with ideas in development, monitoring and evaluation of the whole scheme, and in the outreach to NEETs (not in education, employment and training), mostly young people far away from the labour market who represent a priority target group of the policy scheme. Overall, NGOs can play a decisive role as a possible placement to put into practice the knowledge acquired through formal education, or gain new skills through methods of non-formal education."
25,"The Youth Guarantee

Malgorzata from Warsaw in Poland had a question for UTalk: ¡°I would like to know what the EU is doing to support young people, especially those who are looking for jobs?¡±

Nina Koudelkova, Europe Direct Communication Officer, answered: ¡°EU countries are working towards setting up a Youth Guarantee, a new approach to tackling youth unemployment.


¡°The aim is to ensure that all young people who are up to 25 years old even those not registered with the employment offices, receive good employment offers, continued education, apprenticeships or traineeships within 4 months of finishing school or becoming unemployed.

¡°Some of the measures envisaged include support for high-quality traineeships and apprenticeships, mobility support to bring skills and jobs together, and start-up support for young entrepreneurs.

¡°Developing and delivering a Youth Guarantee scheme requires strong cooperation between all the key stakeholders such as: public authorities, employment services, career guidance providers, education & training institutions, youth support services, business, employers, trade unions.

¡°The Youth Guarantee is above all a structural reform and in many countries requires much change. To make the Youth Guarantee a reality, national budgets need to prioritise youth employment.

¡°The EU will top up national spending on these schemes through the European Social Fund for the period 2014-2020, together with the Youth Employment Initiative, which has a budget of 6 billion euros and is an additional help for European regions with youth unemployment at above 25%.

¡°All EU Member States have presented national Youth Guarantee implementation plans, and their implementation is now starting.¡±"
26,"YOUTH GUARANTEE, THE COPERNICAN REVOLUTION

With more than 5.5 million of young people who were unemployed, in 2013, youth unemployment rates in Europe reached the maximum level ever recorded in the history of the Union and in the majority of the Member States. As a results of the concern over the risk of a ¡°lost generation¡±, the Council of the European Union proposed the Youth Guarantee, namely to provide an opportunity of education, training or employment, to all young people aged 15-24 within four months since they become unemployed, and invited all the Member States for its rapid implementation.

Given the huge sense of urgency, the Youth Guarantee underwent a very rapid implementation All Member States started the implementation of this new policy framework by presenting their National Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans and putting in place immediate measures for bringing young people back into education or employment. In doing so, Member States have adopted different implementation strategies. Some, such as France, have chosen a more holistic approach using the Youth Guarantee as a means of improving links between labour market, education and Vocational Educational Training (VET) provisions as well as youth and social policies more generally. Other countries, such as Spain or Greece, opted for a narrower approach ? predominantly focusing on employment and on the labour market dimension.

Member States may have applied different strategies but similar policy tools have been put in place. These can be grouped along the following six main categories: a strengthened provision of information, council and guidance services to all youth, development of outreach programs, innovative tools to assist school-to-work transitions, enhanced set of training and work-based learning, an improved VET and apprenticeships system as well as measures to promote self-employment.

However, despite all the efforts done by Member States, two years after its launch, in some countries the Youth Guarantee still appear to be as a Copernican revolution in youth policies which will take time and costly major reforms to be fully completed.

In fact, the full effectiveness of the youth guarantee is ensured by three main factors: better coordinated policies for youth; early activation of the young job seeker, limiting the risk of long term disengagement from the labour market; individualised approach on the job seeker, ensuring an optimal matching between the needs of the job unemployed and the opportunity received, maximising in this way its effectiveness and the chances of his/her re-integration. These three main factors are based on a full and working partnership among all stakeholders and labour market actors as well as on well-developed Public Employment Services, (PES), able to deliver the wide range of tasks required. Unfortunately these ingredients seem to be missing in some Member States where Public Employment Services are not ready for full and timely provision of the services required within youth guarantee while lack of trust among various actors make difficult and intensive the achievement of a well-functioning partnership.

For this reason, besides putting in place immediate measures for bringing young people back into education or employment, the Youth Guarantee entails long-term reforms to improve the capacity and capabilities of Public Employment Services targeted at young people. Reforming such structures and adapting them more readily to the labour market needs of young people is a long-term project which can be costly. However, and despite recent labour market improvements, such reforms need to move ahead, with all stakeholders and labour market actors working together to ensure that this Copernican revolution is completed and the Youth Guarantee delivers its promises.

"
27,"THE YOUTH GUARANTEE: CAN IT MAKE AN IMPACT ON YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT?

The Employment Ministers of EU Member States have just reached political agreement on a Youth Guarantee Scheme. With youth unemployment rates across Europe continuing to mount, to what extent can such a scheme bring young people back into the labour market and make them a participatory and active part of society?

On 28th February, the Council of the European Union reached political agreement on a Recommendation to establish Youth Guarantee schemes in EU Member States. These schemes aim to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship, within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.

Avoiding a ¡®lost generation¡¯

The Recommendation on the Youth Guarantee has come at a time when youth unemployment has become a grave and EU-wide issue. Across Europe, 24% of young people are without a job. In Greece and Spain, over half of young people cannot find employment. The effects of such a crisis are wide-reaching. According to Eurofound, the cost of having so many people out of the labour market stands at 153 billion Euros annually, corresponding to more than 1.2% of GDP in Europe. In agreeing on the Youth Guarantee, Member States recognize that for this situation to improve, young people require special consideration in employment policies, and specific measures to facilitate their access to the labour market.

The Youth Guarantee in practice

How much can the Youth Guarantee do in tackling this epidemic, though? Examining countries that have a youth guarantee in place reveal very clearly its positive potential. Finland introduced a form of the youth guarantee in 1996 that focused on offering personalised employment services to young people. Combined with active labour market measures such as traineeships and support in accessing education and training, the scheme has proved very popular: 83.5% of young jobseekers received a successful intervention within 3 months of registering as unemployed in 2011. In Austria, the tailored public employment services for young people at risk of social exclusion have resulted in Austria having one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in Europe.

The challenges faced

Despite these successes, there are certain difficulties associated with the implementation of the scheme. The Swedish version, in place since 1984, encountered grave challenges during the crisis due to increased demands; this was mirrored in Finland, where, in 2009, there was one youth adviser to every 700 clients. Furthermore, the Danish scheme has proved problematic due to the condition of not being able to receive unemployment benefits without participating in the scheme, resulting in a negative relationship between young people and public employment services.

More is needed

These challenges point clearly to the fact that the 6 billion euros recently committed by the EU to deal with youth unemployment is a start, but it is not enough. From the national level, investment in public employment services in order to make them more youth-friendly is imperative, as is the establishment of strong partnerships with all stakeholders. Early intervention and activation is crucial in order to avoid young people becoming or remaining NEETs (not in employment, education or training) and being at risk of social exclusion and poverty.

Furthermore, the fact that the scheme has had limited impact on entrenched ¡®hard to reach¡¯ unemployed youth, points to the importance of involving youth organisations in its implementation. Youth organisations across Europe are adept in providing career-focused training and in developing a culture of entrepreneurship. In their capacity to reach out directly to young people, they must be seen as a vital actor in the effective application and monitoring of the Youth Guarantee.

Clearly, the Youth Guarantee is a very significant step against the ever-worsening crisis of youth unemployment in Europe. Implementing the scheme must not be seen as a cost for national governments; it must be perceived as a necessary and invaluable investment, with long-term advantages, in a generation of young people that all too easily can be forgotten."
